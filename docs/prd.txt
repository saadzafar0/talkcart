# 🛍️ AI Personal Shopper Hackathon Challenge

---

## 1. The Problem

Websites used in e-commerce are dull. They are mere collections of fixed pictures. There is no one to consult, no one to bargain with, and no human touch.

### 🎯 Your Mission

Create an e-commerce site (using Shopify, Next.js, or any template you like) that includes an **AI Personal Shopper**.

This AI should not just chat — it must be able to **manage the site and assist users in purchasing items**.

---

## 2. The Core Requirements (Must Haves)

---

### A. The Storefront (The Body)

we are making a custom backend

#### ✅ Requirement

The site must look **professional** and include:

* Product List
* Cart
* Checkout Page

---

### B. The RAG-Based Agent (The Clerk)

You must embed an AI Assistant (**The Clerk**) that has access to the inventory.

#### 🚫 The “No-Menu” Rule

A user must also be able to find and buy a product **without clicking a single add-to-cart/buy button**, just by talking to the Clerk.

---

### 🧠 Capabilities

1. **Semantic Search**
   Example:

   > “I need an outfit for a summer wedding in Italy.”
   > The Clerk must suggest light linens and sunglasses — not winter coats.

2. **Inventory Check**
   Example:

   > “Do you have this in blue?”
   > The Clerk checks the JSON/database and answers accurately.

3. **Defined User Journey**
   When the Clerk responds with products, it must:

   * Display rich product results (schema)
   * Show basic info (reviews, price, etc.)
   * Include a hyperlink to the specific product page

---

### C. The Real Value Addition

The Clerk should not just talk — it must act.

#### 🎨 The “Vibe Filter”

If the user says:

> “Show me cheaper options.”

The website UI must update instantly to sort by price.

The chatbot must trigger a function that changes the website layout in real time.

---

#### 🛒 Sales Agent Mode

The agent must recommend relevant products based on the user’s past activity data.

---

## 3. The “Haggle Mode”

### 🎭 The Scenario

Users love personalized deals. Most impressive sales figures are achieved through hyper-personalization.

You must build a **Negotiation Bot** feature.

---

### 💬 The Task

The user can ask the Clerk for a discount.

---

### 🧠 The Logic

The Clerk has a hidden **“Bottom Price.”**

* If the user gives a good reason
  (e.g., “It’s my birthday” or “I’m buying two”),
  the Clerk generates a unique coupon code and applies it to the cart.

* If the user is rude,
  the Clerk raises the price.

---

### ⚙️ Tech Requirement

Use OpenAI Function Calling to:

* Generate a code like `BDAY-20`
* Inject it into the cart session

---

## 4. Scoring Rubric (Total: 100 Points)

## 🏆 Evaluation Criteria

| Category                | Points | Success Criteria                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The "Clerk" Personality | 30     | Is the bot helpful/funny, or does it feel robotic?                                |
| Visual Polish           | 30     | Does the store look trustworthy? (Good images, clean fonts)                       |
| UI Integration          | 20     | Does the chat actually change the website? (Filters products, adds to cart, etc.) |
| "Haggle" Logic          | 20     | Can I negotiate a discount? Does the bot have a spine (refuses lowball offers)?   |

If you want, I can also turn this into a **Notion-ready version**, a **PDF brief**, or a **presentation outline** for your team.
